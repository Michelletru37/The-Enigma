# The-Enigma

This project involves building a simulator for a generalized 
version of the Enigma machine that Germany used during World War II 
to encrypt its military communications. The program takes descriptions
of possible initial configurations of the machine and messages to encode or decode.

The Enigmas effect a substitution cipher, on the letters of a message. 
That is, at any given time, the machine performs a permutation---a one-to-one mapping---
of the alphabet onto itself. The alphabet consists solely of the 26 letters in one case 
(there were various conventions for spaces and punctuation).
