* B BETA III IV I AXLE (HQ) (EX) (IP) (TR) (BY)
FROM his shoulder Hiawatha
Took the camera of rosewood
Made of sliding folding rosewood
Neatly put it all together
In its case it lay compactly
Folded into nearly nothing
But he opened out the hinges
Pushed and pulled the joints
   and hinges
Till it looked all squares
   and oblongs
Like a complicated figure
zn the Second Book of Euclid
